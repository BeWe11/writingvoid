        <h2>Why does this site exist?</h2>
        <p>
          Sometimes my fear of the blank page prevents me from writing anything
          at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_writing">Freewriting</a>,
          the act of writing anything that comes to your mind for a few minutes,
          can help overcoming this fear by forcing you to write without judging
          what you've written.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've found that I cannot stop judging the quality of what I've written
          during freewriting even if I try. The simple fact that the result of
          my writing lies before me on the screen triggers me look for typos,
          grammar mistakes and bad style.
        </p>
        <p>
          This site was created to help me practice freewriting. The text field
          deletes everything that was written in it after two seconds,
          preventing me from judging my output altogether.
        </p>
        <p>
          I could just use a text editor and delete my output manually every few
          seconds. I've found that knowing that what I write will be deleted
          automatically helps keeping anxiety low.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've also written a small site that contains
          <a href="https://www.writingexercise.com">writing exercises</a>.
          There's not a lot of content on it, but it's free and might help you
          to ignite your creative spark.
